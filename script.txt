Script to follow for class:
1. Create repo and git push
    0. "Show how to share it with other people."
    # Commands:
    I. git init
    II. git add .
    III. git commit -m "First Commit"
    IV. push https://github.com/josejuanWSB/test_repo.git master
2. Git pull
    I. Change something in the remote repo by the GitHub editor (right corner inside of a file)
    # Command:
    II. git pull https://github.com/josejuanWSB/test_repo.git master
3. Git merge/solving conflicts
    I. Change a line in the remote repo and make a commit by GitHub editor, like before.
    II. Change the same line in the local repo by adding something different than in the remote repo
    # Commands:
    III. Try to -> git pull https://github.com/josejuanWSB/test_repo.git master
    IV. It fails, so:
        a. First you need to add and reflect the changes
        # Commands:
        b. git add .
        c. git commit -m "Committing on local repo"
        d. git pull https://github.com/josejuanWSB/test_repo.git master
        ## There is a conflict, that needs to be solved manually.
